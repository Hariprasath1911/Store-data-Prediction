**🌟 Unlocking Insights with Deep Learning! 🌟**
Excited to share my latest project—a **Deep Learning Model** for Store Sales Prediction! 🛍️📊
With this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting weekly store sales using advanced neural networks. Key highlights include:
✅ Feature engineering for holiday impact, seasonal trends, and promotions
✅ Data cleaning to ensure high-quality input for the model
✅ Normalization, rank transformations, and optimized hyperparameters
✅ ReLU activation function to enhance model performance
✅ Deployment via a sleek Streamlit app for real-time predictions
